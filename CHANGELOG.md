# Tree Controller Change Log
## Patch V1.1.1
* Fixed Ctrl Key culture info issue that affected some users.
* Improved collaboration with Line Tool Lite.

## Update V1.1.0
* While brushing and changing types you can select multiple types of trees to make a custom set.
* You can save custom sets to 5 buttons that you can use or override later.
* Tooltips thanks to Algernon.
* Everything in the vegetation tab is now included in type changing and random rotation.
* Random rotation toggle gets saved.
* Increased randomness when choosing what type to use within a set.
* Various UI and other bugfixes.
* The Foliage Color Data folder for custom seasonal colors has moved to a permanent location: %AppData%...\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Mods_Yenyang_Tree_Controller\FoliageColorData\ . I am not aware of anyone using this feature but I regret that the files in old location may be deleted with the update if using a mod manager.
